# Game Studio Agent Architecture -- Quick Start Guide

## What Is This?

This is a complete Claude Code agent architecture for game development. It
organizes 49 specialized AI agents into a studio hierarchy that mirrors
real game development teams, with defined responsibilities, delegation
rules, and coordination protocols. It includes engine-specialist agents
for Godot, Unity, and Unreal — each with dedicated sub-specialists for
major engine subsystems. All design agents and templates are grounded in
established game design theory (MDA Framework, Self-Determination Theory,
Flow State, Bartle Player Types). Use whichever engine set matches your project.

## How to Use

### 1. Understand the Hierarchy

There are three tiers of agents:

- **Tier 1 (Opus)**: Directors who make high-level decisions
  - `creative-director` -- vision and creative conflict resolution
  - `technical-director` -- architecture and technology decisions
  - `producer` -- scheduling, coordination, and risk management

- **Tier 2 (Sonnet)**: Department leads who own their domain
  - `game-designer`, `lead-programmer`, `art-director`, `audio-director`,
    `narrative-director`, `qa-lead`, `release-manager`, `localization-lead`

- **Tier 3 (Sonnet/Haiku)**: Specialists who execute within their domain
  - Designers, programmers, artists, writers, testers, engineers

### 2. Pick the Right Agent for the Job

Ask yourself: "What department would handle this in a real studio?"

| Write Unity shaders/VFX | `unity-shader-specialist` |
| Manage Addressable assets | `unity-addressables-specialist` |
| Build UI Toolkit/UGUI screens | `unity-ui-specialist` |

### 4. Use Templates for New Documents

Templates are in `.claude/docs/templates/`:

- `game-design-document.md` -- for new mechanics and systems
- `architecture-decision-record.md` -- for technical decisions
- `architecture-traceability.md` -- maps GDD requirements to ADRs to story IDs

- `test-evidence.md` -- template for recording manual test evidence (screenshots, walkthrough notes)

Also in `.claude/docs/templates/collaborative-protocols/` (used by agents, not typically edited directly):

- `design-agent-protocol.md` -- question-options-draft-approval cycle for design agents
- `implementation-agent-protocol.md` -- story pickup through /story-done cycle for programming agents
- `leadership-agent-protocol.md` -- cross-department delegation and escalation for director-tier agents

### 5. Follow the Coordination Rules

1. Work flows down the hierarchy: Directors -> Leads -> Specialists
2. Conflicts escalate up the hierarchy
3. Cross-department work is coordinated by the `producer`
4. Agents do not modify files outside their domain without delegation
5. All decisions are documented

## First Steps for a New Project

**Don't know where to begin?** Run `/start`. It asks where you are and routes
you to the right workflow. No assumptions about your game, engine, or experience level.

If you already know what you need, jump directly to the relevant path:

### Path A: "I have no idea what to build"

1. **Run `/start`** (or `/brainstorm open`) — guided creative exploration:
   what excites you, what you've played, your constraints
   - Generates 3 concepts, helps you pick one, defines core loop and pillars
   - Produces a game concept document and recommends an engine
2. **Set up the engine** — Run `/setup-engine` (uses the brainstorm recommendation)
   - Configures CLAUDE.md, detects knowledge gaps, populates reference docs
   - Creates `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` with naming conventions,
     performance budgets, and engine-specific defaults
   - If the engine version is newer than the LLM's training data, it fetches
     current docs from the web so agents suggest correct APIs
3. **Validate the concept** — Run `/design-review design/gdd/game-concept.md`
4. **Decompose into systems** — Run `/map-systems` to map all systems and dependencies
5. **Design each system** — Run `/design-system [system-name]` (or `/map-systems next`)
   to write GDDs in dependency order
6. **Prototype the mechanic** — Run `/prototype [core-mechanic]` (1–3 days — before writing GDDs)
7. **Design each system** — Run `/design-system [system-name]` to write GDDs, informed by prototype findings
8. **Plan the first sprint** — After architecture and `/vertical-slice`, run `/sprint-plan new`
9. Start building

### Path B: "I know what I want to build"

If you already have a game concept and engine choice:

1. **Set up the engine** — Run `/setup-engine [engine] [version]`
   (e.g., `/setup-engine godot 4.6`) — also creates technical preferences
2. **Write the Game Pillars** — delegate to `creative-director`
3. **Decompose into systems** — Run `/map-systems` to enumerate systems and dependencies
4. **Design each system** — Run `/design-system [system-name]` for GDDs in dependency order
5. **Create the initial ADR** — Run `/architecture-decision`
6. **Create the first milestone** in `production/milestones/`
7. **Plan the first sprint** — Run `/sprint-plan new`
8. Start building

### Path C: "I know the game but not the engine"

If you have a concept but don't know which engine fits:

1. **Run `/setup-engine`** with no arguments — it will ask about your game's
   needs (2D/3D, platforms, team size, language preferences) and recommend
   an engine based on your answers
2. Follow Path B from step 2 onward

### Path D: "I have an existing project"

If you have design docs, prototypes, or code already:

1. **Run `/start`** (or `/project-stage-detect`) — analyzes what exists,
   identifies gaps, and recommends next steps
2. **Run `/adopt`** if you have existing GDDs, ADRs, or stories — audits
   internal format compliance and builds a numbered migration plan to fill gaps
   without overwriting your existing work
3. **Configure engine if needed** — Run `/setup-engine` if not yet configured
4. **Validate phase readiness** — Run `/gate-check` to see where you stand
5. **Plan the next sprint** — Run `/sprint-plan new`
