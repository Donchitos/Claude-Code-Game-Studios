# /smoke-check — Phase 3: Check Test Coverage

> Part of `/smoke-check`. `SKILL.md` names when to read this file; the settings it

## Phase 3: Check Test Coverage

Draw the story list from, in priority order:
1. The QA plan found in Phase 1 (its Test Summary table lists expected test
   file paths per story)
2. The current sprint plan from `production/sprints/` (most recently modified
   file)
3. If the `quick` argument was passed, skip this phase entirely and note:
   "Coverage scan skipped — run `/smoke-check sprint` for full coverage
   analysis."

For each story in scope:

1. Extract the system slug from the story's file path
   (e.g., `production/epics/combat/story-001.md` → `combat`)
2. Glob `tests/unit/[system]/` and `tests/integration/[system]/` for files
   whose name contains the story slug or a closely related term
3. Check the story file itself for a `Test file:` header field or a
   "Test Evidence" section

Assign a coverage status to each story:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **COVERED** | A test file was found matching this story's system and scope |
| **MANUAL** | Story type is Visual/Feel or UI; a test evidence document was found |
| **MISSING** | Logic or Integration story with no matching test file |
| **EXPECTED** | Config/Data story — no test file required; spot-check is sufficient |
| **UNKNOWN** | Story file missing or unreadable |

MISSING entries are advisory gaps. They do not cause a FAIL verdict but must
appear prominently in the report and must be resolved before `/story-done` can
fully close those stories.
