When this skill is invoked:

## 1. Parse Arguments

Four modes:

- **Full spec**: `/setup-engine godot 4.6` — engine and version provided
- **Engine only**: `/setup-engine unity` — engine provided, version will be looked up
- **No args**: `/setup-engine` — fully guided mode (engine recommendation + version)
- **Refresh**: `/setup-engine refresh` — update reference docs (see Section 10)
- **Upgrade**: `/setup-engine upgrade [old-version] [new-version]` — migrate to a new engine version (see Section 11)

---

## 2. Guided Mode (No Arguments)

If no engine is specified, run an interactive engine selection process:

### Check for existing game concept
- Read `design/gdd/game-concept.md` if it exists — extract genre, scope, platform
  targets, art style, team size, and any engine recommendation from `/brainstorm`
- If no concept exists, inform the user:
  > "No game concept found. Consider running `/brainstorm` first to discover what
  > you want to build — it will also recommend an engine. Or tell me about your
  > game and I can help you pick."

### If the user wants to pick without a concept, ask in this order:

**Question 1 — Prior experience** (ask this first, always, via `AskUserQuestion`):
- Prompt: "Have you worked in any of these engines before?"
- Options: `Godot` / `Unity` / `Unreal Engine 5` / `Multiple — I'll explain` / `None of them`
- If they pick a specific engine → recommend that engine. Prior experience outweighs all other factors. Confirm with them and skip the matrix.
- If "None" or "Multiple" → continue to the questions below.

**Questions 2-6 — Decision matrix inputs** (only if no prior engine experience):

**Question 2 — Target platform** (ask this second, always, via `AskUserQuestion` — platform eliminates or heavily weights engines before any other factor):
- Prompt: "What platforms are you targeting for this game?"
- Options: `PC (Steam / Epic)` / `Mobile (iOS / Android)` / `Console` / `Web / Browser` / `Multiple platforms`
- Platform rules that feed directly into the recommendation:
  - Mobile → Unity strongly preferred; Unreal is a poor fit; Godot is viable for simple mobile
  - Console → Unity or Unreal; Godot console support requires third-party publishers or significant extra work
  - Web → Godot exports cleanly to web; Unity WebGL is functional; Unreal has poor web support
  - PC only → all engines viable; other factors decide
  - Multiple → Unity is the most portable across PC/mobile/console

1. **What kind of game?** (2D, 3D, or both?)
2. **Primary input method?** (keyboard/mouse, gamepad, touch, or mixed?)
3. **Team size and experience?** (solo beginner, solo experienced, small team?)
4. **Any strong language preferences?** (GDScript, C#, C++, visual scripting?)
5. **Budget for engine licensing?** (free only, or commercial licenses OK?)

### Produce a recommendation

Do NOT use a simple scoring matrix that eliminates engines. Instead, reason through the user's profile against the honest tradeoffs below, then present 1-2 recommendations with full context. Always end with the user choosing — never force a verdict.

**Engine honest tradeoffs:**

**Godot 4**
- Genuine strengths: 2D (best in class), stylized/indie 3D, rapid iteration, free forever (MIT), open source, gentlest learning curve, best for solo devs who want full control
- Real limitations: 3D ecosystem is thin compared to Unity/Unreal (fewer tutorials, assets, community answers for 3D-specific problems); large open-world 3D is very hard and largely untested in Godot; console export requires third-party publishers or significant extra work; smaller professional job market
- Licensing reality: Truly free with no revenue thresholds ever. MIT license means you own everything.
- Best fit: 2D games of any scope; stylized/atmospheric 3D; contained 3D worlds (not open-world); first game projects where learning curve matters; projects where budget is a hard constraint at any scale

**Unity**
- Genuine strengths: Industry standard for mid-scope 3D and mobile; massive asset store and tutorial ecosystem; C# is a professional language; best console certification support for indie; strong community for almost every genre
- Real limitations: Licensing controversy in 2023 damaged trust (runtime fee was proposed then walked back — the risk of policy changes remains real); C# has a steeper initial curve than GDScript; heavier editor than Godot for simple projects
- Licensing reality: Free under $200K revenue AND 200K installs (Unity Personal/Plus). Only becomes costly if the game is genuinely successful — most indie games never hit this threshold. The 2023 controversy is worth knowing about but the actual current terms are reasonable for most indie developers.
- Best fit: Mobile games; mid-scope 3D; games targeting console; developers with C# background; projects needing large asset store; teams of 2-5

**Unreal Engine 5**
- Genuine strengths: Best-in-class 3D visuals (Lumen, Nanite, Chaos physics); industry standard for AAA and photorealistic 3D; large open-world support is mature and production-tested; Blueprint visual scripting lowers C++ barrier; strong for games targeting high-end PC or console
- Real limitations: Steepest learning curve; heaviest editor (slow compile times, large project sizes); overkill for stylized/2D/small-scope games; C++ is genuinely hard; not suitable for mobile or web; 5% royalty past $1M gross revenue
- Licensing reality: 5% royalty only applies AFTER $1M gross revenue per title. For a first game or any game that doesn't reach $1M, it costs nothing. This threshold is high enough that most indie developers will never pay it.
- Best fit: AAA-quality 3D; large open-world games; photorealistic visuals; developers with C++ experience or willing to use Blueprint; games targeting high-end PC/console where visual fidelity is a core selling point

**Genre-specific guidance** (factor this into the recommendation):
- 2D any style → Godot strongly preferred
- 3D stylized / atmospheric / contained world → Godot viable, Unity solid alternative
- 3D open world (large, seamless) → Unity or Unreal; Godot is not production-proven for this
- 3D photorealistic / AAA-quality → Unreal
- Mobile-first → Unity strongly preferred
- Console-first → Unity or Unreal; Godot console support requires extra work
- Horror / narrative / walking sim → any engine; match to art style and team experience
- Action RPG / Soulslike → Unity or Unreal for 3D; community support and assets matter here
- Platformer 2D → Godot
- Strategy / top-down / RTS → Godot or Unity depending on 2D vs 3D

**Recommendation format:**
1. Show a comparison table with the user's specific factors as rows
2. Give a primary recommendation with honest reasoning
3. Name the best alternative and when to choose it instead
4. Explicitly state: "This is a starting point, not a verdict — you can always migrate engines, and many developers switch between projects."
5. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm: "Does this recommendation feel right, or would you like to explore a different engine?"
   - Options: `[Primary engine] (Recommended)` / `[Alternative engine]` / `[Third engine]` / `Explore further` / `Type something`

**If the user picks "Explore further":**
Use `AskUserQuestion` with concept-specific deep-dive topics. Always generate these options from the user's actual concept — do not use generic options. Always include at minimum:
- The primary engine's specific limitations for this concept (e.g., "How far can Godot 3D actually go for [genre]?")
- The alternative engine's specific tradeoffs for this concept
- Language choice impact on this concept's technical challenges
- Any concept-specific technical concern (e.g., adaptive audio, open-world streaming, multiplayer netcode)

The user can select multiple topics. Answer each selected topic in depth before returning to the engine confirmation question.

---

## 3. Look Up Current Version

Once the engine is chosen:

- If version was provided, use it
- If no version provided, use WebSearch to find the latest stable release:
  - Search: `"[engine] latest stable version [current year]"`
  - Confirm with the user: "The latest stable [engine] is [version]. Use this?"

---

## 4. Update CLAUDE.md Technology Stack

### Language Selection (Godot only)

If Godot was chosen, ask the user which language to use **before** showing the proposed Technology Stack:

> "Godot supports two primary languages:
>
>   **A) GDScript** — Python-like, Godot-native, fastest iteration. Best for beginners, solo devs, and teams coming from Python or Lua.
>   **B) C#** — .NET 8+, familiar to Unity developers, stronger IDE tooling (Rider / Visual Studio), slight performance advantage on heavy logic.
>   **C) Both** — GDScript for gameplay/UI scripting, C# for performance-critical systems. Advanced setup — requires .NET SDK alongside Godot.
>
> Which will this project primarily use?"

Record the choice. It determines the CLAUDE.md template, naming conventions, specialist routing, and which agent is spawned for code files throughout the project.

---

Read `CLAUDE.md` and show the user the proposed Technology Stack changes.
Ask: "May I write these engine settings to `CLAUDE.md`?"

Wait for confirmation before making any edits.

Update the Technology Stack section, replacing the `[CHOOSE]` placeholders with the actual values:

**For Godot** — use the template matching the language chosen above. See **Appendix A** at the bottom of this skill for all three variants (GDScript, C#, Both).

**For Unity:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Unity [version]
- **Language**: C#
- **Build System**: Unity Build Pipeline
- **Asset Pipeline**: Unity Asset Import Pipeline + Addressables
```

**For Unreal:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine [version]
- **Language**: C++ (primary), Blueprint (gameplay prototyping)
- **Build System**: Unreal Build Tool (UBT)
- **Asset Pipeline**: Unreal Content Pipeline
```

---

## 5. Populate Technical Preferences

After updating CLAUDE.md, create or update `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` with
engine-appropriate defaults. Read the existing template first, then fill in:

### Engine & Language Section
- Fill from the engine choice made in step 4

### Naming Conventions (engine defaults)

**For Godot** — see **Appendix A** for GDScript, C#, and Both variants.

**For Unity (C#):**
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- Public fields/properties: PascalCase (e.g., `MoveSpeed`)
- Private fields: _camelCase (e.g., `_moveSpeed`)
- Methods: PascalCase (e.g., `TakeDamage()`)
- Files: PascalCase matching class (e.g., `PlayerController.cs`)
- Constants: PascalCase or UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

**For Unreal (C++):**
- Classes: Prefixed PascalCase (`A` for Actor, `U` for UObject, `F` for struct)
- Variables: PascalCase (e.g., `MoveSpeed`)
- Functions: PascalCase (e.g., `TakeDamage()`)
- Booleans: `b` prefix (e.g., `bIsAlive`)
- Files: Match class without prefix (e.g., `PlayerController.h`)

### Input & Platform Section

Populate `## Input & Platform` using the answers gathered in Section 2 (or extracted
from the game concept). Derive the values using this mapping:

| Platform target | Gamepad Support | Touch Support |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| PC only | Partial (recommended) | None |
| Console | Full | None |
| Mobile | None | Full |
| PC + Console | Full | None |
| PC + Mobile | Partial | Full |
| Web | Partial | Partial |

For **Primary Input**, use the dominant input for the game genre:
- Action/RPG/platformer targeting console → Gamepad
- Strategy/point-and-click/RTS → Keyboard/Mouse
- Mobile game → Touch
- Cross-platform → ask the user

Present the derived values and ask the user to confirm or adjust before writing.

Example filled section:
```markdown
## Input & Platform
- **Target Platforms**: PC, Console
- **Input Methods**: Keyboard/Mouse, Gamepad
- **Primary Input**: Gamepad
- **Gamepad Support**: Full
- **Touch Support**: None
- **Platform Notes**: All UI must support d-pad navigation. No hover-only interactions.
```

### Remaining Sections
- **Performance Budgets**: Use `AskUserQuestion`:
  - Prompt: "Should I set default performance budgets now, or leave them for later?"
  - Options: `[A] Set defaults now (60fps, 16.6ms frame budget, engine-appropriate draw call limit)` / `[B] Leave as [TO BE CONFIGURED] — I'll set these when I know my target hardware`
  - If [A]: populate with the suggested defaults. If [B]: leave as placeholder.
- **Testing**: Suggest engine-appropriate framework (GUT for Godot, NUnit for Unity, etc.) — ask before adding.
- **Forbidden Patterns**: Leave as placeholder — do NOT pre-populate.
- **Allowed Libraries**: Leave as placeholder — do NOT pre-populate dependencies the project does not currently need. Only add a library here when it is actively being integrated, not speculatively.

> **Guardrail**: Never add speculative dependencies to Allowed Libraries. For example, do NOT add GodotSteam unless Steam integration is actively beginning in this session. Post-launch integrations should be added to Allowed Libraries when that work begins, not during engine setup.

### Engine Specialists Routing

Also populate the `## Engine Specialists` section in `technical-preferences.md` with the correct routing for the chosen engine:

**For Godot** — see **Appendix A** for the routing table matching the language chosen.

**For Unity:**
```markdown
## Engine Specialists
- **Primary**: unity-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: unity-specialist (C# review — primary covers it)
- **Shader Specialist**: unity-shader-specialist (Shader Graph, HLSL, URP/HDRP materials)
- **UI Specialist**: unity-ui-specialist (UI Toolkit UXML/USS, UGUI Canvas, runtime UI)
- **Additional Specialists**: unity-dots-specialist (ECS, Jobs system, Burst compiler), unity-addressables-specialist (asset loading, memory management, content catalogs)
- **Routing Notes**: Invoke primary for architecture and general C# code review. Invoke DOTS specialist for any ECS/Jobs/Burst code. Invoke shader specialist for rendering and visual effects. Invoke UI specialist for all interface implementation. Invoke Addressables specialist for asset management systems.

### File Extension Routing

| File Extension / Type | Specialist to Spawn |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Game code (.cs files) | unity-specialist |
| Shader / material files (.shader, .shadergraph, .mat) | unity-shader-specialist |
| UI / screen files (.uxml, .uss, Canvas prefabs) | unity-ui-specialist |
| Scene / prefab / level files (.unity, .prefab) | unity-specialist |
| Native extension / plugin files (.dll, native plugins) | unity-specialist |
| General architecture review | unity-specialist |
```

**For Unreal:**
```markdown
## Engine Specialists
- **Primary**: unreal-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: ue-blueprint-specialist (Blueprint graphs) or unreal-specialist (C++)
- **Shader Specialist**: unreal-specialist (no dedicated shader specialist — primary covers materials)
- **UI Specialist**: ue-umg-specialist (UMG widgets, CommonUI, input routing, widget styling)
- **Additional Specialists**: ue-gas-specialist (Gameplay Ability System, attributes, gameplay effects), ue-replication-specialist (property replication, RPCs, client prediction, netcode)
- **Routing Notes**: Invoke primary for C++ architecture and broad engine decisions. Invoke Blueprint specialist for Blueprint graph architecture and BP/C++ boundary design. Invoke GAS specialist for all ability and attribute code. Invoke replication specialist for any multiplayer or networked systems. Invoke UMG specialist for all UI implementation.

### File Extension Routing

| File Extension / Type | Specialist to Spawn |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Game code (.cpp, .h files) | unreal-specialist |
| Shader / material files (.usf, .ush, Material assets) | unreal-specialist |
| UI / screen files (.umg, UMG Widget Blueprints) | ue-umg-specialist |
| Scene / prefab / level files (.umap, .uasset) | unreal-specialist |
| Native extension / plugin files (Plugin .uplugin, modules) | unreal-specialist |
| Blueprint graphs (.uasset BP classes) | ue-blueprint-specialist |
| General architecture review | unreal-specialist |
```

### Collaborative Step
Present the filled-in preferences to the user. For Godot, include the chosen language and note where the full naming conventions and routing tables live:
> "Here are the default technical preferences for [engine] ([language if Godot]). The naming conventions and specialist routing are in Appendix A of this skill — I'll apply the [GDScript/C#/Both] variant. Want to customize any of these, or shall I save the defaults?"

For all other engines, present the defaults directly without referencing the appendix.

Wait for approval before writing the file.

---

## 6. Determine Knowledge Gap

Check whether the engine version is likely beyond the LLM's training data.

**Known approximate coverage** (update this as models change):
- LLM knowledge cutoff: **May 2025**
- Godot: training data likely covers up to ~4.3
- Unity: training data likely covers up to ~2023.x / early 6000.x
- Unreal: training data likely covers up to ~5.3 / early 5.4

Compare the user's chosen version against these baselines:

- **Within training data** → `LOW RISK` — reference docs optional but recommended
- **Near the edge** → `MEDIUM RISK` — reference docs recommended
- **Beyond training data** → `HIGH RISK` — reference docs required

Inform the user which category they're in and why.

---

## 7. Populate Engine Reference Docs

### If WITHIN training data (LOW RISK):

Create a minimal `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`:

```markdown
# [Engine] — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | [version] |
| **Project Pinned** | [today's date] |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | LOW — version is within LLM training data |

## Note

This engine version is within the LLM's training data. Engine reference
docs are optional but can be added later if agents suggest incorrect APIs.

Run `/setup-engine refresh` to populate full reference docs at any time.
```

Do NOT create breaking-changes.md, deprecated-apis.md, etc. — they would
add context cost with minimal value.

### If BEYOND training data (MEDIUM or HIGH RISK):

Create the full reference doc set by searching the web:

1. **Search for the official migration/upgrade guide**:
   - `"[engine] [old version] to [new version] migration guide"`
   - `"[engine] [version] breaking changes"`
   - `"[engine] [version] changelog"`
   - `"[engine] [version] deprecated API"`

2. **Fetch and extract** from official documentation:
   - Breaking changes between each version from the training cutoff to current
   - Deprecated APIs with replacements
   - New features and best practices

Ask: "May I create the engine reference docs under `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/`?"

Wait for confirmation before writing any files.

3. **Create the full reference directory**:
   ```
   docs/engine-reference/<engine>/
   ├── VERSION.md              # Version pin + knowledge gap analysis
   ├── breaking-changes.md     # Version-by-version breaking changes
   ├── deprecated-apis.md      # "Don't use X → Use Y" tables
   ├── current-best-practices.md  # New practices since training cutoff
   └── modules/                # Per-subsystem references (create as needed)
   ```

4. **Populate each file** using real data from the web searches, following
   the format established in existing reference docs. Every file must have
   a "Last verified: [date]" header.

5. **For module files**: Only create modules for subsystems where significant
   changes occurred. Don't create empty or minimal module files.

---

## 8. Update CLAUDE.md Import

Ask: "May I update the `@` import in `CLAUDE.md` to point to the new engine reference?"

Wait for confirmation, then update the `@` import under "Engine Version Reference" to point to the
correct engine:

```markdown
## Engine Version Reference

@docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md
```

If the previous import pointed to a different engine (e.g., switching from
Godot to Unity), update it.

---

## 9. Update Agent Instructions

Ask: "May I add a Version Awareness section to the engine specialist agent files?" before making any edits.

For the chosen engine's specialist agents, verify they have a
"Version Awareness" section. If not, add one following the pattern in
the existing Godot specialist agents.

The section should instruct the agent to:
1. Read `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`
2. Check deprecated APIs before suggesting code
3. Check breaking changes for relevant version transitions
4. Use WebSearch to verify uncertain APIs

---

## 10. Refresh Subcommand

If invoked as `/setup-engine refresh`:

1. Read the existing `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` to get
   the current engine and version
2. Use WebSearch to check for:
   - New engine releases since last verification
   - Updated migration guides
   - Newly deprecated APIs
3. Update all reference docs with new findings
4. Update "Last verified" dates on all modified files
5. Report what changed

---

## 11. Upgrade Subcommand

If invoked as `/setup-engine upgrade [old-version] [new-version]`:

### Step 1 — Read Current Version State

Read `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` to confirm the current pinned
version, risk level, and any migration note URLs already recorded. If
`old-version` was not provided as an argument, use the pinned version from this
file.

### Step 2 — Fetch Migration Guide

Use WebSearch and WebFetch to locate the official migration guide between
`old-version` and `new-version`:

- Search: `"[engine] [old-version] to [new-version] migration guide"`
- Search: `"[engine] [new-version] breaking changes changelog"`
- Fetch the migration guide URL from VERSION.md if one is already recorded,
  or use the URL found via search.

Extract: renamed APIs, removed APIs, changed defaults, behavior changes, and
any "must migrate" items.

### Step 3 — Pre-Upgrade Audit

Scan `src/` for code that uses APIs known to be deprecated or changed in the
target version:

- Use Grep to search for deprecated API names extracted from the migration
  guide (e.g., old function names, removed node types, changed property names)
- List each file that matches, with the specific API reference found

Present the audit results as a table:

```
Pre-Upgrade Audit: [engine] [old-version] → [new-version]
==========================================================

Files requiring changes:
  File                              | Deprecated API Found       | Effort
  --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------
  src/gameplay/player_movement.gd   | old_api_name               | Low
  src/ui/hud.gd                     | removed_node_type          | Medium

Breaking changes to watch for:
  - [change description from migration guide]
  - [change description from migration guide]

Recommended migration order (dependency-sorted):
  1. [system/layer with fewest dependencies first]
  2. [next system]
  ...
```

If no deprecated APIs are found in `src/`, report: "No deprecated API usage
found in src/ — upgrade may be low-risk."

### Step 4 — Confirm Before Updating

Ask the user before making any changes:

> "Pre-upgrade audit complete. Found [N] files using deprecated APIs.
> Proceed with upgrading VERSION.md to [new-version]?
> (This will update the pinned version and add migration notes — it does NOT
> change any source files. Source migration is done manually or via stories.)"

Wait for explicit confirmation before continuing.

### Step 5 — Update VERSION.md

After confirmation:

1. Update `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`:
   - `Engine Version` → `[new-version]`
   - `Project Pinned` → today's date
   - `Last Docs Verified` → today's date
   - Re-evaluate and update the `Risk Level` and `Post-Cutoff Version Timeline`
     table if the new version falls beyond the LLM knowledge cutoff
   - Add a `## Migration Notes — [old-version] → [new-version]` section
     containing: migration guide URL, key breaking changes, deprecated APIs
     found in this project, and recommended migration order from the audit

2. If `breaking-changes.md` or `deprecated-apis.md` exist in the engine
   reference directory, append the new version's changes to those files.

### Step 6 — Post-Upgrade Reminder

After updating VERSION.md, output:

```
VERSION.md updated: [engine] [old-version] → [new-version]

Next steps:
1. Migrate deprecated API usages in the [N] files listed above
2. Run /setup-engine refresh after upgrading the actual engine binary to
   verify no new deprecations were missed
3. Run /architecture-review — the engine upgrade may invalidate ADRs that
   reference specific APIs or engine capabilities
4. If any ADRs are invalidated, run /propagate-design-change to update
   downstream stories
```

---

## 12. Output Summary

After setup is complete, output:

```
Engine Setup Complete
=====================
Engine:          [name] [version]
Language:        [GDScript | C# | GDScript + C# | C# | C++ + Blueprint]
Knowledge Risk:  [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
Reference Docs:  [created/skipped]
CLAUDE.md:       [updated]

Next Steps:
1. Review docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md
2. [If from /brainstorm] Run /map-systems to decompose your concept into individual systems
3. [If from /brainstorm] Run /design-system to author per-system GDDs (guided, section-by-section)
4. [If from /brainstorm] Run /prototype [core-mechanic] to validate the core idea before writing GDDs
5. [If fresh start] Run /brainstorm to discover your game concept
6. Create your first milestone: /sprint-plan new
```

---

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — engine configured and reference docs populated.

## Guardrails

- NEVER guess an engine version — always verify via WebSearch or user confirmation
- NEVER overwrite existing reference docs without asking — append or update
- If reference docs already exist for a different engine, ask before replacing
- Always show the user what you're about to change before making CLAUDE.md edits
- If WebSearch returns ambiguous results, show the user and let them decide
- When the user chose **GDScript**: copy the GDScript CLAUDE.md template from Appendix A1 exactly. NEVER add "C++ via GDExtension" to the Language field. GDScript projects may use GDExtension, but it is not a primary project language. The `godot-gdextension-specialist` in the routing table is available for when native extensions are needed — it does not make C++ a project language.

---

## Appendix A — Godot Language Configuration

All Godot-specific variants for language-dependent configuration. Referenced from Sections 4 and 5 — only relevant when Godot is the chosen engine. Use the subsection matching the language chosen in Section 4.

---

### A1. CLAUDE.md Technology Stack Templates

**GDScript:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Build System**: SCons (engine), Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

> **Guardrail**: When using this GDScript template, write the Language field as exactly "`GDScript`" — no additions. Do NOT append "C++ via GDExtension" or any other language. The C# template below includes GDExtension because C# projects commonly wrap native code; GDScript projects do not.

**C#:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: C# (.NET 8+, primary), C++ via GDExtension (native plugins only)
- **Build System**: .NET SDK + Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

**Both — GDScript + C#:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: GDScript (gameplay/UI scripting), C# (performance-critical systems), C++ via GDExtension (native only)
- **Build System**: .NET SDK + Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

---

### A2. Naming Conventions

**GDScript:**
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- Variables/functions: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`)
- Signals: snake_case past tense (e.g., `health_changed`)
- Files: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- Scenes: PascalCase matching root node (e.g., `PlayerController.tscn`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

**C#:**
- Classes: PascalCase (`PlayerController`) — must also be `partial`
- Public properties/fields: PascalCase (`MoveSpeed`, `JumpVelocity`)
- Private fields: `_camelCase` (`_currentHealth`, `_isGrounded`)
- Methods: PascalCase (`TakeDamage()`, `GetCurrentHealth()`)
- Signal delegates: PascalCase + `EventHandler` suffix (`HealthChangedEventHandler`)
- Files: PascalCase matching class (`PlayerController.cs`)
- Scenes: PascalCase matching root node (`PlayerController.tscn`)
- Constants: PascalCase (`MaxHealth`, `DefaultMoveSpeed`)

**Both — GDScript + C#:**
Use GDScript conventions for `.gd` files and C# conventions for `.cs` files. Mixed-language files do not exist — the boundary is per-file. When in doubt about which language a new system should use, ask the user and record the decision in `technical-preferences.md`.

---

### A3. Engine Specialists Routing

**GDScript:**
```markdown
## Engine Specialists
- **Primary**: godot-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: godot-gdscript-specialist (all .gd files)
- **Shader Specialist**: godot-shader-specialist (.gdshader files, VisualShader resources)
- **UI Specialist**: godot-specialist (no dedicated UI specialist — primary covers all UI)
