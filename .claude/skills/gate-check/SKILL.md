# Phase Gate Validation

This skill validates whether the project is ready to advance to the next development
phase. It checks for required artifacts, quality standards, and blockers.

**Distinct from `/project-stage-detect`**: That skill is diagnostic ("where are we?").
This skill is prescriptive ("are we ready to advance?" with a formal verdict).

## Production Stages (7)

The project progresses through these stages:

1. **Concept** — Brainstorming, game concept document
2. **Systems Design** — Mapping systems, writing GDDs
3. **Technical Setup** — Engine config, architecture decisions
4. **Pre-Production** — Prototyping, vertical slice validation
5. **Production** — Feature development (Epic/Feature/Task tracking active)
6. **Polish** — Performance, playtesting, bug fixing
7. **Release** — Launch prep, certification

**When a gate passes**, write the new stage name to `production/stage.txt`
(single line, e.g. `Production`). This updates the status line immediately.

---

## 1. Parse Arguments

**Target phase:** `$ARGUMENTS[0]` (blank = auto-detect current stage, then validate next transition)

Also resolve the review mode (once, store for all gate spawns this run):
1. If `--review [full|lean|solo]` was passed → use that
2. Else read `production/review-mode.txt` → use that value
3. Else → default to `lean`

Note: in `solo` mode, director spawns (CD-PHASE-GATE, TD-PHASE-GATE, PR-PHASE-GATE, AD-PHASE-GATE) are skipped — gate-check becomes artifact-existence checks only. In `lean` mode, all four directors still run (phase gates are the purpose of lean mode).

- **With argument**: `/gate-check production` — validate readiness for that specific phase
- **No argument**: Auto-detect current stage using the same heuristics as
  `/project-stage-detect`, then **confirm with the user before running**:

  Use `AskUserQuestion`:
  - Prompt: "Detected stage: **[current stage]**. Running gate for [Current] → [Next] transition. Is this correct?"
  - Options:
    - `[A] Yes — run this gate`
    - `[B] No — pick a different gate` (if selected, show a second widget listing all gate options: Concept → Systems Design, Systems Design → Technical Setup, Technical Setup → Pre-Production, Pre-Production → Production, Production → Polish, Polish → Release)
  
  Do not skip this confirmation step when no argument is provided.

## 2. Phase Gate Definitions

### Gate: Concept → Systems Design

**Required Artifacts:**
- [ ] `design/gdd/game-concept.md` exists and has content
- [ ] Game pillars defined (in concept doc or `design/gdd/game-pillars.md`)
- [ ] Visual Identity Anchor section exists in `design/gdd/game-concept.md` (from brainstorm Phase 4 art-director output)

**Recommended (not blocking):**
- [ ] Concept prototype exists in `prototypes/` with a REPORT.md showing PROCEED verdict
      (`/prototype [core-mechanic]`) — skipping this means GDDs may be written for an
      idea that hasn't been played. Acceptable if the concept is proven by other means.

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] Game concept has been reviewed (`/design-review` verdict not MAJOR REVISION NEEDED)
- [ ] Core loop is described and understood
- [ ] Target audience is identified
- [ ] Visual Identity Anchor contains a one-line visual rule and at least 2 supporting visual principles

---

### Gate: Systems Design → Technical Setup

**Required Artifacts:**
- [ ] Systems index exists at `design/gdd/systems-index.md` with at least MVP systems enumerated
- [ ] All MVP-tier GDDs exist in `design/gdd/` and individually pass `/design-review`
- [ ] A cross-GDD review report exists in `design/gdd/` (from `/review-all-gdds`)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] All MVP GDDs pass individual design review (8 required sections, no MAJOR REVISION NEEDED verdict)
- [ ] `/review-all-gdds` verdict is not FAIL (cross-GDD consistency and design theory checks pass)
- [ ] All cross-GDD consistency issues flagged by `/review-all-gdds` are resolved or explicitly accepted
- [ ] System dependencies are mapped in the systems index and are bidirectionally consistent
- [ ] MVP priority tier is defined
- [ ] No stale GDD references flagged (older GDDs updated to reflect decisions made in later GDDs)

---

### Gate: Technical Setup → Pre-Production

**Required Artifacts:**
- [ ] Engine chosen (CLAUDE.md Technology Stack is not `[CHOOSE]`)
- [ ] Technical preferences configured (`.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` populated)
- [ ] Art bible exists at `design/art/art-bible.md` with at least Sections 1–4 (Visual Identity Foundation)
- [ ] At least 3 Architecture Decision Records in `docs/architecture/` covering
      Foundation-layer systems (scene management, event architecture, save/load)
- [ ] Engine reference docs exist in `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/`
- [ ] Test framework initialized: `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` directories exist
- [ ] CI/CD test workflow exists at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` (or equivalent)
- [ ] At least one example test file exists to confirm the framework is functional
- [ ] Master architecture document exists at `docs/architecture/architecture.md`
- [ ] Architecture traceability index exists at `docs/architecture/requirements-traceability.md`
- [ ] `/architecture-review` has been run (a review report file exists in `docs/architecture/`)
- [ ] `design/accessibility-requirements.md` exists with accessibility tier committed
- [ ] `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` exists (pattern library initialized, even if minimal)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] Architecture decisions cover core systems (rendering, input, state management)
- [ ] Technical preferences have naming conventions and performance budgets set
- [ ] Accessibility tier is defined and documented (even "Basic" is acceptable — undefined is not)
- [ ] At least one screen's UX spec started (often the main menu or core HUD is designed during Technical Setup)
- [ ] All ADRs have an **Engine Compatibility section** with engine version stamped
- [ ] All ADRs have a **GDD Requirements Addressed section** with explicit GDD linkage
- [ ] No ADR references APIs listed in `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/deprecated-apis.md`
- [ ] All HIGH RISK engine domains (per VERSION.md) have been explicitly addressed
      in the architecture document or flagged as open questions
- [ ] Architecture traceability matrix has **zero Foundation layer gaps**
      (all Foundation requirements must have ADR coverage before Pre-Production)

**ADR Circular Dependency Check**: For all ADRs in `docs/architecture/`, read each ADR's
"ADR Dependencies" / "Depends On" section. Build a dependency graph (ADR-A → ADR-B means
A depends on B). If any cycle is detected (e.g. A→B→A, or A→B→C→A):
- Flag as **FAIL**: "Circular ADR dependency: [ADR-X] → [ADR-Y] → [ADR-X].
  Neither can reach Accepted while the cycle exists. Remove one 'Depends On' edge to
  break the cycle."

**Engine Validation** (read `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md` first):
- [ ] ADRs that touch post-cutoff engine APIs are flagged with Knowledge Risk: HIGH/MEDIUM
- [ ] `/architecture-review` engine audit shows no deprecated API usage
- [ ] All ADRs agree on the same engine version (no stale version references)

---

### Gate: Pre-Production → Production

**Required Artifacts:**
- [ ] Vertical slice exists in `prototypes/` with a REPORT.md (run `/vertical-slice`) — **recommended, not blocking**; if absent, surface as CONCERNS
- [ ] First sprint plan exists in `production/sprints/`
- [ ] Art bible is complete (all 9 sections) and AD-ART-BIBLE sign-off verdict is recorded in `design/art/art-bible.md`
- [ ] Entity inventory exists at `design/assets/entity-inventory.md` (recommended — run `/asset-spec` with no arguments to generate collaboratively from GDDs + art bible)
- [ ] All MVP-tier GDDs from systems index are complete
- [ ] Master architecture document exists at `docs/architecture/architecture.md`
- [ ] At least 3 ADRs covering Foundation-layer decisions exist in `docs/architecture/`
- [ ] All Foundation and Core layer ADRs have status `Accepted` (not `Proposed`) — stories cannot be unblocked until their governing ADR is accepted
- [ ] Control manifest exists at `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`
      (generated by `/create-control-manifest` from Accepted ADRs)
- [ ] Epics defined in `production/epics/` with at least Foundation and Core
      layer epics present (use `/create-epics layer: foundation` and
      `/create-epics layer: core` to create them, then `/create-stories [epic-slug]`
      for each epic)
- [ ] Vertical Slice build exists and is playable (not just scope-defined) — **recommended, not blocking**; if absent, surface as CONCERNS
- [ ] Vertical Slice has been playtested with at least 1 documented session — **recommended, not blocking**; if absent, surface as CONCERNS
- [ ] Vertical Slice playtest report exists at `production/playtests/` or equivalent — **recommended, not blocking**; if absent, surface as CONCERNS
- [ ] UX specs exist for key screens: main menu, core gameplay HUD (at `design/ux/`), pause menu
- [ ] HUD design document exists at `design/ux/hud.md` (if game has in-game HUD)
- [ ] All key screen UX specs have passed `/ux-review` (verdict APPROVED or NEEDS REVISION accepted)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] **Core loop fun is validated** — playtest data confirms the central mechanic is enjoyable, not just functional. Explicitly check the Vertical Slice playtest report.
- [ ] UX specs cover all UI Requirements sections from MVP-tier GDDs
- [ ] Interaction pattern library documents patterns used in key screens
- [ ] Accessibility tier from `design/accessibility-requirements.md` is addressed in all key screen UX specs
- [ ] Sprint plan references real story file paths from `production/epics/`
      (not just GDDs — stories must embed GDD req ID + ADR reference)
- [ ] **Vertical Slice is COMPLETE**, not just scoped — the build demonstrates the full core loop end-to-end. At least one complete [start → challenge → resolution] cycle works.
- [ ] Architecture document has no unresolved open questions in Foundation or Core layers
- [ ] All ADRs have Engine Compatibility sections stamped with the engine version
- [ ] All ADRs have ADR Dependencies sections (even if all fields are "None")
- [ ] Manual validation confirms GDDs + architecture + epics are coherent
      (run `/review-all-gdds` and `/architecture-review` if not done recently)
- [ ] **Core fantasy is delivered** — at least one playtester independently described an experience that matches the Player Fantasy section of the core system GDDs (without being prompted).

**Vertical Slice Validation** (only run these checks if a Vertical Slice was built):
- [ ] A human has played through the core loop without developer guidance
- [ ] The game communicates what to do within the first 2 minutes of play
- [ ] No critical "fun blocker" bugs exist in the Vertical Slice build
- [ ] The core mechanic feels good to interact with (this is a subjective check — ask the user)

> **Verdict rules for Vertical Slice:**
> - **Slice was built AND any validation item is NO** → verdict is automatically FAIL. A broken
>   or unfun vertical slice should not advance to Production.
> - **Slice was not built (skipped)** → downgrade to CONCERNS only, not FAIL. Surface the risk
>   clearly: "Advancing without a validated Vertical Slice increases the risk of late-stage design
>   pivots. Recommended before committing full production scope." The user decides.
> - Skipping is a valid solo dev or time-constrained call. Shipping a broken one is not.

---

## 3. Run the Gate Check

**Before running artifact checks**, read `docs/consistency-failures.md` if it exists.
Extract entries whose Domain matches the target phase (e.g., if checking
Systems Design → Technical Setup, pull entries in Economy, Combat, or any GDD domain;
if checking Technical Setup → Pre-Production, pull entries in Architecture, Engine).
Carry these as context — recurring conflict patterns in the target domain warrant
increased scrutiny on those specific checks.

For each item in the target gate:

### Artifact Checks
- Use `Glob` and `Read` to verify files exist and have meaningful content
- Don't just check existence — verify the file has real content (not just a template header)
- For code checks, verify directory structure and file counts

**Systems Design → Technical Setup gate — cross-GDD review check**:
Use `Glob('design/gdd/gdd-cross-review-*.md')` to find the `/review-all-gdds` report.
If no file matches, mark the "cross-GDD review report exists" artifact as **FAIL** and
surface it prominently: "No `/review-all-gdds` report found in `design/gdd/`. Run
`/review-all-gdds` before advancing to Technical Setup."
If a file is found, read it and check the verdict line: a FAIL verdict means the
cross-GDD consistency check failed and must be resolved before advancing.

### Quality Checks
- For test checks: Run the test suite via `Bash` if a test runner is configured
- For design review checks: `Read` the GDD and check for the 8 required sections
- For performance checks: `Read` technical-preferences.md and compare against any
  profiling data in `tests/performance/` or recent `/perf-profile` output
- For localization checks: `Grep` for hardcoded strings in `src/`

### Cross-Reference Checks
- Compare `design/gdd/` documents against `src/` implementations
- Check that every system referenced in architecture docs has corresponding code
- Verify sprint plans reference real work items

---

## 4. Collaborative Assessment

For items that can't be automatically verified, **ask the user**:

- "I can't automatically verify that the core loop plays well. Has it been playtested?"
- "No playtest report found. Has informal testing been done?"
- "Performance profiling data isn't available. Would you like to run `/perf-profile`?"

**Never assume PASS for unverifiable items.** Mark them as MANUAL CHECK NEEDED.

---

## 4b. Director Panel Assessment

**Apply review mode before spawning any director:**
- `solo` → skip all four directors. Note in output: "Director Panel skipped — Solo mode. Gate verdict based on artifact and quality checks only." Proceed to Phase 5.
- `lean` → spawn all four directors (phase gates always run in lean mode — this is their purpose).
- `full` → spawn all four directors as normal.

(Review mode was resolved in Phase 1. Use that stored value here.)

Before generating the final verdict, spawn all four directors as **parallel subagents** via Task using the parallel gate protocol from `.claude/docs/director-gates.md`. Issue all four Task calls simultaneously — do not wait for one before starting the next.

**Spawn in parallel:**

1. **`creative-director`** — gate **CD-PHASE-GATE** (`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`)
2. **`technical-director`** — gate **TD-PHASE-GATE** (`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`)
3. **`producer`** — gate **PR-PHASE-GATE** (`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`)
4. **`art-director`** — gate **AD-PHASE-GATE** (`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`)

Pass to each: target phase name, list of artifacts present, and the context fields listed in that gate's definition.

**Collect all four responses, then present the Director Panel summary:**

```
## Director Panel Assessment

Creative Director:  [READY / CONCERNS / NOT READY]
  [feedback]

Technical Director: [READY / CONCERNS / NOT READY]
  [feedback]

Producer:           [READY / CONCERNS / NOT READY]
  [feedback]

Art Director:       [READY / CONCERNS / NOT READY]
  [feedback]
```

**Apply to the verdict:**
- Any director returns NOT READY → verdict is minimum FAIL (user may override with explicit acknowledgement)
- Any director returns CONCERNS → verdict is minimum CONCERNS
- All four READY → eligible for PASS (still subject to artifact and quality checks from Section 3)

---

## 5. Output the Verdict

```
## Gate Check: [Current Phase] → [Target Phase]

**Date**: [date]
**Checked by**: gate-check skill

### Required Artifacts: [X/Y present]
- [x] design/gdd/game-concept.md — exists, 2.4KB
- [ ] docs/architecture/ — MISSING (no ADRs found)
- [x] production/sprints/ — exists, 1 sprint plan

### Quality Checks: [X/Y passing]
- [x] GDD has 8/8 required sections
- [ ] Tests — FAILED (3 failures in tests/unit/)
- [?] Core loop playtested — MANUAL CHECK NEEDED

### Blockers
1. **No Architecture Decision Records** — Run `/architecture-decision` to create one
   covering core system architecture before entering production.
2. **3 test failures** — Fix failing tests in tests/unit/ before advancing.

### Recommendations
- [Priority actions to resolve blockers]
- [Optional improvements that aren't blocking]

### Verdict: [PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL]
- **PASS**: All required artifacts present, all quality checks passing
- **CONCERNS**: Minor gaps exist but can be addressed during the next phase
- **FAIL**: Critical blockers must be resolved before advancing
```

---

## 5a. Chain-of-Verification

After drafting the verdict in Phase 5, challenge it before finalising.

**Step 1 — Generate 5 challenge questions** designed to disprove the verdict:

> **Tool-action requirement**: At least 2 of the 5 challenge questions below must be answered by re-reading a specific file (Read tool) or re-running a specific check (Grep tool) — not by reflection alone. Mark these with [TOOL ACTION] to indicate a tool was used.

For a **PASS** draft:
- "Which quality checks did I verify by actually reading a file, vs. inferring they passed?"
- "Are there MANUAL CHECK NEEDED items I marked PASS without user confirmation? [TOOL ACTION] Re-scan the checklist for any [?] or MANUAL CHECK items."
- "Did I confirm all listed artifacts have real content, not just empty headers? [TOOL ACTION] Re-read the file and check it has non-placeholder content."
- "Could any blocker I dismissed as minor actually prevent the phase from succeeding?"
- "Which single check am I least confident in, and why?"

For a **CONCERNS** draft:
- "Could any listed CONCERN be elevated to a blocker given the project's current state?"
- "Is the concern resolvable within the next phase, or does it compound over time?"
- "Did I soften any FAIL condition into a CONCERN to avoid a harder verdict?"
- "Are there artifacts I didn't check that could reveal additional blockers?"
- "Do all the CONCERNS together create a blocking problem even if each is minor alone?"

For a **FAIL** draft:
- "Have I accurately separated hard blockers from strong recommendations?"
- "Are there any PASS items I was too lenient about?"
- "Am I missing any additional blockers the user should know about?"
- "Can I provide a minimal path to PASS — the specific 3 things that must change?"
- "Is the fail condition resolvable, or does it indicate a deeper design problem?"

**Step 2 — Answer each question** independently.
Do NOT reference the draft verdict text — re-check specific files or ask the user.

**Step 3 — Revise if needed:**
- If any answer reveals a missed blocker → upgrade verdict (PASS→CONCERNS or CONCERNS→FAIL)
- If any answer reveals an over-stated blocker → downgrade only if citing specific evidence
- If answers are consistent → confirm verdict unchanged

**Step 4 — Note the verification** in the final report output:
`Chain-of-Verification: [N] questions checked — verdict [unchanged | revised from X to Y]`

---

## 6. Update Stage on PASS

When the verdict is **PASS** and the user confirms they want to advance:

1. Write the new stage name to `production/stage.txt` (single line, no trailing newline)
2. This immediately updates the status line for all future sessions

Example: if passing the "Pre-Production → Production" gate:
```bash
echo -n "Production" > production/stage.txt
```

**Always ask before writing**: "Gate passed. May I update `production/stage.txt` to 'Production'?"

---

## 7. Closing Next-Step Widget

After the verdict is presented and any stage.txt update is complete, close with a structured next-step prompt using `AskUserQuestion`.

**Tailor the options to the gate that just ran:**

For **systems-design PASS**:
```
Gate passed. What would you like to do next?
[A] Run /create-architecture — produce your master architecture blueprint and ADR work plan (recommended next step)
[B] Design more GDDs first — return here when all MVP systems are complete
[C] Stop here for this session
```

> **Note for systems-design PASS**: `/create-architecture` is the required next step before writing any ADRs. It produces the master architecture document and a prioritized list of ADRs to write. Running `/architecture-decision` without this step means writing ADRs without a blueprint — skip it at your own risk.

For **technical-setup PASS**:
```
Gate passed. What would you like to do next?
[A] Run /create-control-manifest — generate the layer rules manifest from your Accepted ADRs (do this first)
[B] Run /vertical-slice — build the Vertical Slice (do this before writing epics — validate fun first)
[C] Write more ADRs first — run /architecture-decision [next-system]
[D] Stop here for this session
```

> **Note for technical-setup PASS**: The Pre-Production sequence is deliberately ordered
> to validate fun before committing to detailed planning:
>
> 1. `/create-control-manifest` — extract technical rules from Accepted ADRs (required before epics)
> 2. `/vertical-slice` — build the Vertical Slice **FIRST**, before writing epics or stories
> 3. Playtest → `/playtest-report` — at least 1 session required to pass the Pre-Production gate; 3+ recommended before committing the full team
> 4. `/ux-design [screen]` — UX specs for main menu, core HUD, pause menu (if not done)
> 5. `/create-epics layer:foundation` then `/create-epics layer:core` — plan after fun is validated
> 6. `/create-stories [epic-slug]` for each epic
> 7. `/sprint-plan new`
>
> **Why prototype before epics?** If the prototype reveals the core loop needs to change,
> epics written before that discovery will be partially wrong. Validate fun cheaply first,
> then plan in detail. This is the #1 lesson from GDC postmortem data.

For all other gates, offer the two most logical next steps for that phase plus "Stop here".

---

## 8. Follow-Up Actions

Based on the verdict, suggest specific next steps:

- **No art bible?** → `/art-bible` to create the visual identity specification
- **Art bible exists but no asset specs?** → `/asset-spec system:[name]` to generate per-asset visual specs and generation prompts from approved GDDs
- **No game concept?** → `/brainstorm` to create one
- **No systems index?** → `/map-systems` to decompose the concept into systems
- **Missing design docs?** → `/reverse-document` or delegate to `game-designer`
- **Small design change needed?** → `/quick-design` for changes under ~4 hours (bypasses full GDD pipeline)
- **No UX specs?** → `/ux-design [screen name]` to author specs, or `/team-ui [feature]` for full pipeline
- **UX specs not reviewed?** → `/ux-review [file]` or `/ux-review all` to validate
- **No accessibility requirements doc?** → run `/ux-design` which creates both `design/accessibility-requirements.md` and `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` in one step
- **No interaction pattern library?** → `/ux-design patterns` to initialize it
- **GDDs not cross-reviewed?** → `/review-all-gdds` (run after all MVP GDDs are individually approved)
- **Cross-GDD consistency issues?** → fix flagged GDDs, then re-run `/review-all-gdds`
- **No test framework?** → `/test-setup` to scaffold the framework for your engine
- **No QA plan for current sprint?** → `/qa-plan sprint` to generate one before implementation begins
- **Missing ADRs?** → `/architecture-decision` for individual decisions
- **No master architecture doc?** → `/create-architecture` for the full blueprint
- **ADRs missing engine compatibility sections?** → Re-run `/architecture-decision`
  or manually add Engine Compatibility sections to existing ADRs
- **Missing control manifest?** → `/create-control-manifest` (requires Accepted ADRs)
- **Missing epics?** → `/create-epics layer: foundation` then `/create-epics layer: core` (requires control manifest)
- **Missing stories for an epic?** → `/create-stories [epic-slug]` (run after each epic is created)
- **Stories not implementation-ready?** → `/story-readiness` to validate stories before developers pick them up
- **Tests failing?** → delegate to `lead-programmer` or `qa-tester`
- **No playtest data?** → `/playtest-report`
- **No playtest sessions beyond the minimum?** → Additional sessions give more reliable signal. 3+ total is recommended before committing the full team. Use `/playtest-report` to structure findings.
- **No Difficulty Curve doc?** → Create `design/difficulty-curve.md` from the template at `.claude/docs/templates/difficulty-curve.md` — or use `/quick-design "difficulty curve"` for a guided session.
- **No player journey map?** → Create `design/player-journey.md` from the template at `.claude/docs/templates/player-journey.md` — or author it collaboratively using `/ux-design` Phase 2b.
- **Need a quick sprint check?** → `/sprint-status` for current sprint progress snapshot
- **Performance unknown?** → `/perf-profile`
- **Not localized?** → `/localize`
- **Ready for release?** → `/launch-checklist`

---

## Collaborative Protocol

This skill follows the collaborative design principle:

1. **Scan first**: Check all artifacts and quality gates
2. **Ask about unknowns**: Don't assume PASS for things you can't verify
3. **Present findings**: Show the full checklist with status
4. **User decides**: The verdict is a recommendation — the user makes the final call
5. **Get approval**: "May I write this gate check report to production/gate-checks/?"
6. **Never auto-fix**: If required artifacts are missing, report the FAIL verdict and
   name the skill to run (e.g. "run `/test-setup`"). Do NOT create missing files or
   re-run the gate automatically. Creating files to manufacture a PASS defeats the
   gate's purpose.

**Never** block a user from advancing — the verdict is advisory. Document the risks
and let the user decide whether to proceed despite concerns.
